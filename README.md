# Ionic Keyboard Issue

This repository demonstrates an Ionic issue.
If an ion-input is added inside an ion-item-sliding the content doesn't scroll correctly,
if the input that is focused is overlapped by the native keyboard popup on Android or iOS.


So the ion-input remains overlapped by the keyboard.
